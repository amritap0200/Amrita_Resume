# Hi, I'm Amrita 👋🏼

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering student at PES University, blending hardware systems with intelligent software. My passion lies in human-robot interaction—designing systems that perceive, process, and respond to the physical world.  

I build bridges between circuits and cognition:  
- **Embedded Intelligence**: Arduino/C++ firmware for sensor-actuator systems  
- **Conversational AI**: Python pipelines with Gemini API and speech processing  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for face/object detection in robotics applications

`Arduino` | `ESP32` | `Servo Control` | `Ultrasonic Sensors` | `Raspberry Pi`  

**AI & Software**:  
`Python` | `OpenCV` | `Gemini API` | `gTTS` | `PyTorch (Basics)`  

**Design & Tools**:  
`Git` | `Linux` | `LTspice` | `MATLAB` | `Simulink`

**Other Interests**:  
`Quantum Computing` | `Cybersecurity` | `Signal Processing` | `Sci-Fi Writing`

### 🔥 **Featured Project: Intelligent Human-Interaction Robot** 
A multimodal robotics system combining:
- Real-time human detection using ultrasonic sensor arrays (HC-SR04) and OpenCV-based facial recognition
- Context-aware conversation engine powered by Gemini API with speech-to-text (Google SpeechRecognition) and text-to-speech (gTTS) pipelines 
- Responsive physical interaction via SG90 servo control with PID-based smooth tracking (Arduino/C++)
