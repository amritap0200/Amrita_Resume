🛠️ Building, debugging, and learning—one project at a time 

🌱 Always open to new ideas


I’m a second-year Electronics & Communication Engineering student  passionate about the intersection of hardware and software - anything from embedded systems to AI/ML and even quantum computing. 

My recent robotics project, which integrates sensor networks with conversational AI, reflects my fascination with intelligent systems. I'm particularly drawn to open-source development, where collaborative innovation thrives. 

When not experimenting with circuits or exploring cybersecurity concepts, I channel my analytical mindset into writing fiction and poetry - finding that the same principles of structure and creativity apply to both code and storytelling.
